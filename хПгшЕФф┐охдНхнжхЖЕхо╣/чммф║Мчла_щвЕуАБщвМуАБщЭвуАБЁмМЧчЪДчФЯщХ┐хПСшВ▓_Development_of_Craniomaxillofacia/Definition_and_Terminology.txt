牙齿萌出 (Tooth eruption): The axial or occlusal movement of tooth from its developmental position within the jaw to its functional position in the occlusal plane is known as eruption of teeth.

建𬌗 (Establishment of occlusion): Establishment of any contact between the incising or masticating surfaces of upper and lower teeth.

乳牙𬌗(Deciduous occlusion):From the ${1}^{\text{st }}$ to the ${5}^{\text{th }}$ year, the first primary teeth to erupt are generally the mandibular central incisors, at about 8 months of age. The individual variations apart, it takes around 2.5 to 3.5 years for all the primary teeth to establish their occlusion.

替牙𬌗 (Mixed occlusion): From the ${6}^{\text{th }}$ to the ${12}^{\text{th }}$ year, the period during which both the primary and permanent teeth are present in the mouth together. The mandibular molars are the first to erupt at around 6 years of age. Their position and relation is dependent on the relation of second deciduous molars as they are guided into dental arch by the distal surfaces of these teeth.
