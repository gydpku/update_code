The dental treatment unit, which is a microcosm of stomatological hospital, has certain complexity and involves many disciplines such as equipment and infrastructure. Scientific and reasonable design and construction of oral clinics, as well as the interior decoration that meets industry standards, can greatly improve the quality of stomatology medical services and directly affect the quality of oral clinics social benefits.

For air compressors that are not directly placed in the dental treatment unit but provide power for oral diagnosis and treatment, as well as negative pressure suction systems that provide negative pressure for saliva suction devices, physical environment of different equipment and facilities should be cleaned and isolated for those auxiliary equipment and facilities when designing the oral clinic.

With the increasing number of multi-discipline linkage models in oral diagnosis and treatment, the refined division of departments and the "one-stop" treatment model go hand in hand. In order to better serve patients, the oral clinics should be designed according to different service modes and different disciplines.
