Antitumor Drugs are drugs that can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and fight and treat malignant tumors. They play an extremely important role in the comprehensive treatment of tumors. The rational application of anti-tumor drugs is the key to improving the efficacy, reducing the incidence of adverse reactions and rationally using health resources. Whether the clinical application of anti-tumor drugs is reasonable is based on two aspects: whether there are indications for the use of anti-tumor drugs and whether the selected varieties and dosage regimens are appropriate.

According to the mechanism of action, anti-tumor drugs can be divided into two categories: cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic. Currently, the commonly used anti-tumor drugs include doxorubicin, bleomycin, nitrocaphane, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, fluorouracil, methotrexate, bleomycin A5, paclitaxel, nimotuzumab and sorafenib. Nimotuzumab and sorafenib are two new targeted antitumor drugs for the treatment of head and neck tumors.
