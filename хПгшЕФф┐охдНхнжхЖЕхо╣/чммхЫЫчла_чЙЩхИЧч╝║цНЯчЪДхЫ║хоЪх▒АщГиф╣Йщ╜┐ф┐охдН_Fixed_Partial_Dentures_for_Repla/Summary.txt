Missing teeth can be replaced by a tooth supported fixed partial denture. Several factors as biomechanical, periodontal, esthetic, financial and patient's wishes must be considered carefully before making a decision. If the abutment teeth are healthy, the retainers, pontic and connectors are well designed, the fixed partial denture can be expected to provide good function and a long time service for the patient.
