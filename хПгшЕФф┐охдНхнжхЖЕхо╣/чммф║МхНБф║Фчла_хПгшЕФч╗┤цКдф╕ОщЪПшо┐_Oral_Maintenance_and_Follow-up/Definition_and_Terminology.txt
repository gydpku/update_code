1. 口腔卫生自我维护 (personal oral hygiene maintenance): Personal maintenance of the cleanliness of teeth and/or oral implants and other oral structures by removal of bacterial plaque and food debris with brushes, dental floss or other auxiliary devices.

2. 洁牙 ( dental scaling ) : removing plaque, calculus, stains or other deposits from surface of teeth or oral implant by a dental scaler.

3. 随访 (follow-up): Periodic monitoring of patient health after implant placement and prosthesis connection, including that of clinical study or trial participants.

4. 口腔检查和评估 (oral examination and assessment): Process of assessing the oral cavity to ascertain the state of health or disease; may include visualization, digital palpation, percussion, auscultation, radiographic analysis and functional measurement techniques.

5. 患者满意度 (patient satisfaction): Individual's perceived fulfillment of a need or a want; can be measured by obtaining reports or ratings from patients about services received from a healthcare provider.

6. 种植体周围组织退缩 (peri-implant tissue recession): Location of the receding marginal peri-implant tissue apical to the prosthesis-implant interface.

7. 牙周动度仪 ( periostest ) : Instrument used to measure the relative mobility of teeth and dental implant. Device utilizes a tapping piston to percuss a tooth or an implant four times per second. Rate of deceleration recorded at the point of contact is measured as the relative stiffness of the tooth or implant.

8. 共振频率分析 (resonance frequency analysis): Determination of the relative stiffness of an implant within the bone via attachment of a resonance frequency transducer containing two piezo-ceramic elements to an implant. One piezo element is excited by an electrical signal, and the resulting vibration is measured by the second element. The higher the resulting frequency, the stiffer the implant-to-bone connection.
