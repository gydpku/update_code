Implants are fundamentally different from natural teeth in that they have no periodontal membrane. No connective tissue fibers at the implant-bone interface could integrate into the surface of the implant. Soft tissue seal at the trans-mucosal portion of the implant is also weaker and easier to be infected than gingival-tooth complex. Consequently, regular oral examination and assessment, well-performed peri-implant maintenance and follow-up are essential to prevent complications occurred in the surrounding hard and soft tissue, and would enhance the long-term success rate of implant treatment. Plaque control is regarded as the main method and aim for peri-implant maintenance, which could be performed by the patients themselves and by the dentists.

1. Self-maintenance by the patients

For the patients, both mechanical and chemical plaque control methods, including tooth brush, dental floss, interdental brush, mouth wash and oral irrigators are recommended to maintain a high-level oral hygiene. When choosing these methods, dentists should take the implant location, length, angulations of abutments, superstructure design, anatomical limitations and habits of each patient into consideration. Patients should be instructed in advance to master the proper hygiene techniques. In addition, in order to increase the predictability of the long-term success rate of dental implants, patients should be advised to quit smoking permanently.
