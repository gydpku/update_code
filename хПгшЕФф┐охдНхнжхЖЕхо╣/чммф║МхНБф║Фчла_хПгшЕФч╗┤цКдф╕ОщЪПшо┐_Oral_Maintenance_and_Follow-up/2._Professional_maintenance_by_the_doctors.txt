When peri-implant plaque formed, dental scaling is suggested. Traditional metal scalers ( e.g., stainless steel or titanium) are not recommended because of the risk of surface damage, metal contamination and the galvanic corrosion. As a result, only carbon fiber or plastic instruments could be used to scale the implant. Conventional ultrasonic scalers with a non-metal tip are also suitable for implant maintenance. In addition, It is well-documented that higher failure rate could be found in implant patients with diabetes. Therefore, professional treatment and control of diabetes is strongly recommended to reduce the unfavorable effect of diabetes.

3. Follow-up and assessment

By regular follow-up, dentists could collect and assess information of implant denture from patients' self-assessment and oral examinations. Patient satisfaction and abnormal sensation ( e.g., discomfort, food impaction and pain) should be carefully considered, which could often help to find out potential problems. As for oral examinations, Peri-implant plaque index ( PLI ), calculus index, food impaction examination should be performed to evaluate oral health condition; Periostest or RFA are used to assess implant mobility; Peri-implant gingival health could be assessed by means of papilla index, gingival index, attachment examination, pocket probing and bleeding index examination; Radiographic interpretation ( parallel periapical radiographs, panoramic radiographs ) could be regarded as an effective diagnostic tool to assess implant crestal bone loss. All these examination results should be monitored and analyzed for future maintenance.

In one word, oral maintenance and follow-up are essential after implant-borne prosthesis connection, and would play a key role to achieve long-term implant success.
