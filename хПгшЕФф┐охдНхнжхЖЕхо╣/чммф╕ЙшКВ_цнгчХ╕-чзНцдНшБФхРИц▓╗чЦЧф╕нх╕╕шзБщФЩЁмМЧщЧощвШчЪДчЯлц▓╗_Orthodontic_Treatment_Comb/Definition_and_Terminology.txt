1. 功能性重建 ( functional reconstruction ): The reconstruction surgery should achieve the objective of function restoration. Denture and masticatory function are the key points for functional jaw reconstruction.

2. 血管化腓骨瓣 ( vascularized fibula flap ): The fibula free flap provides a strong long segment of bone and can include a large fasciocutaneous component as well. The vascular pedicle of the fibula flap is the peroneal artery accompanied by two veins. It is very popular for mandible and maxilla reconstruction.

3. 血管化髂骨瓣 ( vascularized iliac crest flap ): The vascularized iliac crest flap provides very extensive amount of bone and allows for insertion of dental implants without difficulty. The dominant vascular pedicle is the deep circumflex iliac artery ( DCIA ) .

4. 非血管化骨移植(non-vascularized bone graft): Non-vascularized bone graft is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone with autologous cortical and/or cancellous bone without vascular pedicle. Iiliac crest is the most common donor site. (毛 驰 彭 歆 波)
