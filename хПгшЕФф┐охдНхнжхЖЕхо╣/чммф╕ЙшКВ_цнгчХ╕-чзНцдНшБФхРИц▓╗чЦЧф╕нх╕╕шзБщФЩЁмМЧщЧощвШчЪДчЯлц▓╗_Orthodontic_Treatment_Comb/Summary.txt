The goals of functional reconstruction of the jaws are as follows: restoration of bone continuity, face convexity, alveolar height, bone volume, relationship between maxilla and mandible and functional denture. Both aesthetic and functional outcome should be achieved after the reconstruction surgery. The treatment plan for jaw reconstruction should be made based on the comprehensive clinical and radiographic examination and model investigation. Vascularized and non-vascularized bone graft could be applied for jaw reconstruction. Free fibula and iliac crest flaps is the most commonly used vascularized flaps for jaw reconstruction. Nonvascularized iliac bone graft is used for the reconstruction of small defects. Free composite fibula flap is the most popular osseous flap for both mandibular and maxillary defects reconstruction. High primary stability for dental implants placed in free fibula grafts could be achieved. The insufficient height of the fibula is the key problem for mandibular reconstruction. Moving the bone graft upward, second onlay bone graft, double barrel fibula graft and vertical distraction osteogenesis may increase the height of fibula graft for the denture restoration. Free composite fibula flap could simultaneously repair both hard and soft tissue defects for maxillary reconstruction.
