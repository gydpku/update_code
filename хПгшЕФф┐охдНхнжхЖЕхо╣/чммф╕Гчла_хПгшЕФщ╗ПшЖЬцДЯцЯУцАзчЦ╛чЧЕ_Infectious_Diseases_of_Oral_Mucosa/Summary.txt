Reiter's syndrome ( RS ) is a form of arthritis that affects the eyes, urethra, skin and joints. The disease may be acute or chronic, with spontaneous remissions or recurrences. RS primarily affects males around the age of 30 . The cause of RS is unknown, which were considered by a combination of genetic vulnerability and various disease agents.

The initial symptoms of RS are inflammation either of the urethra or the intestines, followed by acute arthritis. Arthritis usually affects the weight-bearing joints in the legs. Other symptoms include: inflammation of the urethra, oral ulcers, conjunctivitis, keratoderma blennorrhagica. There is no specific treatment for RS. Symptomatic treatment may be useful.
