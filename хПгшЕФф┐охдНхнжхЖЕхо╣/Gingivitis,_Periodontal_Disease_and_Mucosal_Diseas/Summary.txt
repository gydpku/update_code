A wide array of systemic diseases encountered in internal medicine have manifestations in the oral cavity, specifically, so do many granulomatous, immunologic, hematologic and microbial diseases. Oral involvement often precedes the occurrence of other symptoms or development of lesions at other locations. Careful examination of the oral cavity may reveal findings indicative of an underlying systemic condition, and allow for early diagnosis and treatment. In this chapter, the oral manifestations and diagnosis of some common systemic disorders, including leukemia, neutropenia, congenital syphilis, juvenile localized scleroderma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis, are described. The field of human genetics is advancing rapidly, and large numbers of genetic diseases have been found to present with oral, dental, and craniofacial malformations. The etiology, clinical feature, diagnosis, treatment plan and prevention of genetic disorders that frequently have associated oral manifestations, including cleidocranial dysplasia, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, hypophosphatasia, palmoplantar keratodermas and periodontoclasia, osteogenesis imperfecta, Rieger syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa, Down syndrome, hereditary gingival fibromatosis, vitamin D-resistant rickets, and leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 are discussed. Furthermore, oral manifestations, diagnosis and treatment plan of psychological diseases such as self-mutilation are also included in this chapter.
