This chapter mainly described some basic surgical rules of oral implantology. Accurate and minimal invasive surgical technique proposed by Br√•nemark is the basic principle of modern implantology. The flap should be designed to guarantee enough blood supply, preserve the papilla and vestibular outline, and provide clear surgical visual field and space for instruments accession. The damage of nearby vita structure should be avoided. To preserve or reconstruct enough attached gingiva around the emergence area is crucial for long term clinical result. Different locations and edentulous status also influence the incision strategy. Graded drilling insures the correct implant position and angulation, and prevents excessive heat during drilling, which is detrimental to the bone tissue. Each implant system has its own surgical kit, the surgeon should exactly follow the instruction provided by the company. The implant surface should be untouched before insertion into the bone cavity. Insertion torque between ${30} \sim  {50}\mathrm{\;N} \cdot  \mathrm{{cm}}$ is appropriate for good primary stability. Tension free wound closure can be achieved by mattress suture combined with interrupted suture. Soft tissue can be modified during the second stage for a better aesthetic results by many ways of surgical intervention.
