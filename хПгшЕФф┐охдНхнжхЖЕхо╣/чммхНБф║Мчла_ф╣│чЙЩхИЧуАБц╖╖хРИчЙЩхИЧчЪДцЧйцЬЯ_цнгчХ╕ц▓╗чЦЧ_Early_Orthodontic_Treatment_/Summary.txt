Children are in the dynamic process of growth and development. It should be the goal of pediatric dentists to assess and guide the developing occlusion toward optimal outcomes. Comprehensive examination is necessary to achieve this goal. Anterior and posterior crossbite, oral habits, and some eruptive disturbance are most commonly encountered in children and adolescents. Their clinical manifestations and therapy are discussed in this chapter.
