1. 前牙反𬌗 ( anterior crossbite ) : Dentoalveolar anterior crossbite represents a linguoversion of one or more maxillary anterior teeth with resultant "locking" behind the opposing mandibular teeth in full closure.

2. 功能性后牙反𬌗 (functional posterior crossbite): It involves a lateral shift of the mandible during closure in response to transverse occlusal interferences between the maxillary and mandibular arch-widths. The deviation of the mandible presents as a unilateral crossbite in centric occlusion involving multiple posterior teeth on one side, normal buccolingual occlusion of the contralateral side and a deviation of the lower midline and chin toward the crossbite side.
