1. 牙槽嵴骨增量 (alveolar ridge augmentation): Surgical augmentation of the alveolar ridge in a horizontal and/or vertical direction using one of several approaches based on the size and/or location of the defect.

2. 骨生成作用 ( bone regeneration ) : Renewal or repair of lost bone tissue. Also: Cellular events during wound healing; recapitulation of cellular events of embryogenesis.

3. 骨诱导作用 ( osteoinduction ) : Transformation of osteoprogenitor cells to active osteoblasts via paracrine signals to appropriate receptors.

4. 骨传导作用 (osteoconduction): Physical aid to osteoid formation via species-specific or alloplastic scaffold with nonending porosity.

5. 牙槽嵴劈开技术 ( ridge splitting technique ): Augmentation procedure to increase the width of a narrow residual alveolar ridge by surgically splitting it or by expanding it with a series of osteotomes of increasing diameter. [ See also ] ridge expansion technique.

6. 牙槽嵴扩张术 (ridge expansion technique): Augmentation procedure to increase the width of a narrow residual alveolar ridge by surgically splitting it or by expanding it with a series of osteotomes of increasing diameter. [ See also ] ridge splitting technique.

7. 外置法植骨技术 (onlay bone grafting): Graft used in block form and fixed upon the cortical surface of the recipient bed with a screw. Origin may be autograft, allograft, alloplast, or xenograft.

8. 下颌骨颊板区 (mandibular buccal shelf): The surface of the mandible from the residual alveolar ridge or alveolar ridge to the external oblique line in the region of the lower buccal vestibule. It is covered with cortical bone.
