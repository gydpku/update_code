Endosseous implants require sufficient bone volume for ideal implant placement.

The aim of this chapter is to describe the different bone enhancing techniques for improving the alveolar ridge prior to implant placement, to provide reader with a clear approach to contemporary bone reconstruction techniques, the anatomy and biology behind these and a guide for fresh person to perform the appropriate procedures.

The chapter is divided into seven sections. Section 1 focuses on basic principles in bone augmentation procedures. Section 2 is about flap design and surgical access for ridge augmentation. Section 3 describes techniques for ridge expansion by bone splitting. Bone splitting is a simple and less invasive procedure in the ridge augmentation procedures. Section 4 describes techniques for reconstruction of the atrophic alveolar bone by onlay graft. Section 5 describes bone harvesting methods. Bone grafting is commonly used for augmentation of the atrophic edentulous maxilla and mandible. Although bone substitutes and GBR technique have also been successful in clinical practice ( this will be discussed in other chapter ), fresh autogenous bone grafts remain the 'gold standard' in reconstructive surgery.

Complications in alveolar ridge augmentation are described in section 6.As with any surgery, surgical treatment to alveolar ridge augmentation is not without risk. Many complications related to surgery may occur. Some of these may be severe and some may affect the outcome. We should be aware of these risks and the management techniques prior to the surgery. Section 7 gives the suggestions on the appropriate time of implant implantation after autogenous bone transplantation.
