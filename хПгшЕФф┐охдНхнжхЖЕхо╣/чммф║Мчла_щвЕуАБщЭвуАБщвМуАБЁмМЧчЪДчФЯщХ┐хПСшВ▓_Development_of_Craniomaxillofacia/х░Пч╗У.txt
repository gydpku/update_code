颅颌面部的胚胎发育受到基因调控, 牙胚沿颌骨定位, 按一定的时间顺序发育和萌出。除遗传因素外, 母体患病、营养状况等也可能影响这一进程。至胎儿出生, 生理功能逐渐对颅面形态产生影响, 从个体的婴幼儿阶段到少年、青年阶段, 越来越多的外部因素影响到发育过程。这种外部影响主要以力的形式施加。牙齿萌出后最终定位在各方向力的平衡区域之中。但是由遗传而决定的解剖形态仍然可能使下颌的运动具有个体特征, 而功能又可能反过来对形态起到 “塑造” 作用。 角嵴咬合在上颌第二乳磨牙的颊沟;

Definition and Terminology

牙齿萌出 Tooth eruption

The axial or occlusal movement of tooth from its developmental position within the jaw to its

functional position in the occlusal plane is known as eruption of teeth.

建𬌗 Establishment of occlusion

Establishment of any contact between the incising or masticating surfaces of upper and lower teeth. 乳牙𬌗 Deciduous occlusion

From the ${1}^{\text{st }}$ to the ${5}^{\text{th }}$ year, the first primary teeth to erupt are generally the mandibular central incisors, at about 8 months of age. The individual variations apart, it takes around 2.5 to 3.5 years for all the primary teeth to establish their occlusion.

替牙𬌗 Mixed occlusion

From the ${6}^{\text{th }}$ to the ${12}^{\text{th }}$ year, the period during which both the primary and permanent teeth are present in the mouth together. The mandibular molars are the first to erupt at around 6 years of age. Their position and relation is dependent on the relation of second deciduous molars as they are guided into dental arch by the distal surfaces of these teeth.
