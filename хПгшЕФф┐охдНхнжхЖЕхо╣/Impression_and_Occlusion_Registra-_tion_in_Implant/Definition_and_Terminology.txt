1. 研究模型 (study casts): Study casts represent the exact contours of the oral surfaces of residual dentition and edentulous jaw(s). It is necessary to articulate the study casts to identify important detail that affect the design of the proposed prostheses. These help in assessing potential space for positioning implants and components, as well as recognizing any problems associated with the relationships of jaws and the existing or future occlusion of the dental arches.

2. 诊断性排牙 ( diagnostic wax-ups ) : Diagnostics wax-ups are essential in preoperative planning. It has considerable benefit when prepared during the surgical phase, or immediately after the completion of surgery, in order to secure optimum functional and aesthetic outcomes from implant treatment.
