骨结合 (osseointegration): Direct structural and functional connection between ordered, living bone and the surface of a load-carrying titanium implant. Osseointegration is considered to be the phenomenon of direct apposition of bone on an implant surface, which subsequently undergoes structural adaptation in response to a mechanical load.

种植修复体或种植义齿 (implant prosthesis, implant denture): The prostheses such as crown and other fixed dental prostheses, removable dental prostheses, and maxillofacial prostheses can be supported and retained in part or whole by oral implants.

植入体 (implant body): The portion of a dental implant that provides support for the abutment through adaptation upon ( eposteal ), within ( endosteal ), or through ( transosteal ) the bone.

基台 (abutment): The portion of a dental implant that serves to support and/or retain a prosthesis.

上部结构 (superstructure): Framework skeleton for the attachment of a matrix holding artificial teeth comprising the prosthesis, which is connected directly to dental implants, an infrastructure, and/ or as mesostructure. Also called suprastructure.

被动就位 (passive fit): Adaptation of one component to another in a manner that does not impart strain. In dental implant prosthodontics, the creation of passively fitting prostheses is desirable. 第九章 颌面缺损修复工艺
