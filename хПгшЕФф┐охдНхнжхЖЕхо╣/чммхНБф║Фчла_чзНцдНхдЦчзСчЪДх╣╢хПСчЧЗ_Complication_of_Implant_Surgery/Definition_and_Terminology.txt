1. 牙龈乳头指数 (papilla index): Papilla index is designated five different levels indicating the amount of papilla present, the absolutely absence of papilla for level 0 , height of papilla less than $1/2$ for level 1, height of papilla more than $1/2$ but not all the way up to contact point for level 2, papilla fills up the entire proximal space for level 3, papilla hyperplastic and too full of adjacent clearance for level 4.

2. 种植体保护𬌗 (implant protective occlusion, IPO) : Implant protective occlusion (IPO) is an occlusal scheme suggested to decrease overload on the implant supported prosthesis and enable its successful functioning in the oral set-up. This occlusal scheme is a combination of various principles which need to be addressed when fabricating implant supported prosthesis.
