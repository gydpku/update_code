1. 束状骨 (bundle bone): The inner socket wall of thin, compact bone called the alveolar bone proper, which is seen as the lamina dura in radiographs. Histologically, it contains a series of openings ( cribriform plate ) through which neurovascular bundles link the periodontal ligment with the central component of the alveolar bone, the cancellous bone.

2. Wollf 规律 ( Wollf's Law ) : Every change in the function of a bone is followed by certain definite changes in its internal architecture and its external conformation.

3. 下齿槽神经 ( inferior alveolar nerve ): The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve, which is the third branch of the trigeminal nerve arising from the trigeminal ganglion. It has both sensory and motor divisions.

4. 颏神经前袢 (anterior loop of mental nerve): Mental nerve traverses inferiorly and anteriorly to the mental foramen before turning back to exit the foramen. The nerve may be found anterior to the mental foramen by as much as $3\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ .
