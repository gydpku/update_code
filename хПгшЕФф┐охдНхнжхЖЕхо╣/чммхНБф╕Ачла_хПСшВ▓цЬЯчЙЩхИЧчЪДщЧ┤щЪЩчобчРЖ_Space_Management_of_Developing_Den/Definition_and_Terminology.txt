1. 间隙保持 (space maintenance): When early primary tooth loss occurs, problems may arise that affect the alignment of the permanent dentition. Corrective measures such as passive space maintenance may be needed to optimize the normal process of occlusion development.

2. 丝圈式间隙保持器 (band and loop space maintainer): It is most often used for early loss of single primary molar. The appliance incorporates a band on the distal molar with a soldered wire-loop extension extending forward to contact the distal-cervical surface of the mesial adjacent tooth.
