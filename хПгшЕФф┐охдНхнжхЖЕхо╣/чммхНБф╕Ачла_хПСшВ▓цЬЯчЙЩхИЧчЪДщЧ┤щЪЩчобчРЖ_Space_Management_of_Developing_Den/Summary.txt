When early primary tooth loss occurs, the arch integrity is disrupted and the alignment of the permanent dentition may be affected. Measures such as space maintenance should be taken to minimize the negative influence. When designing the space maintainer, several factors should be taken into consideration, including the development stage of the successive permanent tooth, the eruption sequence of the adjacent teeth and the time elapsed since tooth loss. The indication and clinical manipulation of the frequently-used space maintainer were discussed in this chapter.
