Guided bone regeneration ( GBR ) is one of the most important techniques in modern implantology. This concept is based on the principle that specific cells contribute to the formation of specific tissues. Exclusion of faster-growing epithelium and connective tissue from a bony defect for a period of 6 to 8 weeks allows the slower growing tissues to occupy the space adjacent to the implant.

The indications for GBR technique include bony defect surrounding implant during implant placement and/or bony defect induced by peri-implantitis. The key points for GBR surgery include reconstructing the bony defect by suitable grafting material, maintaining the created space by suitable membrane and closing the wound tension- freely by releasing the buccal flap. To get more predictable bone regeneration results, the bone substitute and membrane materials for GBR technique are developing fast.
