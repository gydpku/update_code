1. 牙冠 (crown): The anatomic crown is the part of a tooth normally covered by an enamel surface. The clinical crown refers specifically to the amount of tooth visible in the oral cavity.

2. 唇面 ( labial surface ): The facial surface of anterior teeth are properly called labial surfaces, located next to the lip. The facial surfaces of a tooth is the surface toward the face, that is, the outer surface of a tooth in the mouth resting against or next to the cheeks or lips.

3. 舌面 ( lingual surface ) : Lingual surface is the surface of a maxillary or mandibular tooth nearest the tongue.

4. 邻面 (proximal surface): Proximal surface is the side of a tooth generally next to an adjacent tooth.

5. 牙根 (root): The anatomic root is the part of a tooth covered by a cementum surface. The clinical root refers to the amount of tooth that is not visible since it is beneath the gingival.

6. 𬌗面 ( occlusal surface ) : Occlusal surface is the chewing surface of a posterior tooth.

7. 髓腔 (pulp cavity): The pulp cavity is the cavity in the central portion of the tooth containing the nerves and blood supply to the tooth. It is divided into the pulp chamber (more coronal) and the root canals (in the roots).

8. 牙釉质 (enamel): Enamel is the white, protective external surface of the anatomic crown. It is highly calcified or mineralized and is the hardest substance in the body. The mineral content is ${95}\%$ calcium hydroxyapatite. The remaining substances include $4\%$ water and $1\%$ enamel matrix.

9. 牙本质 ( dentin ): The dentin is the hard, yellowish tissue underlying the enamel and cementum making up the major bulk of the inner portion of each tooth crown and root. It extends internally from the pulp cavity in the center of the tooth outward to the inner surface of the enamel or cementum. Mature dentin is composed of about ${70}\%$ calcium hydroxyapatite. ${18}\%$ organic matter and ${12}\%$ water, making it harder than cementum but softer than enamel.

10. 牙髓 (dental pulp ): The pulp is the soft connective tissue in the pulp cavity containing a rich supply of blood vessels and nerves.
