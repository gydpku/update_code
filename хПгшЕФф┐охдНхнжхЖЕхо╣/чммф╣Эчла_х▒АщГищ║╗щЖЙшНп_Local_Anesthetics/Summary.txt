Glucocorticoids are very important regulatory molecules in the body. They have antiinflammatory, anti-toxic, anti-allergic, anti-shock, non-specific immunosuppressive and antipyretic effects. They can prevent the occurrence of immunological inflammatory reactions and pathological immune reactions. They can be divided into natural glucocorticoids and synthetic glucocorticoids according to the source. Natural glucocorticoids have important physiological functions. Synthetic glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive pharmacological effects for severe infection, allergy, autoimmune disease, leukemia and shock, and are divided into three categories: short-acting, medium-acting and long-acting. Long-term use of glucocorticoids in large doses also has serious side effects, so it is necessary to fully grasp the indications, contraband, adverse reactions and matters needing attention in the use of such drugs.
