1. 牙髓切断术 (pulpotomy): When the soft tissue in the pulp chamber is inflamed, but the soft tissue in the canals is still healthy enough, the pulp from the chamber is removed and a special medicament can be put into the chamber in an attempt to keep the remaining pulp alive, and to stimulate repair of the remaining vital radicular pulp.

2. 乳牙根管治疗术 (root canal therapy in primary teeth): When the pulp has an infection that can not be resolved, all of the pulp in the pulp chamber and root canal of a tooth is removed to prevent the infection from spreading and the root canals are filled with a dressing.

3. 牙根形成术 ( apexogenesis ) : Apexogenesis refers to a vital pulp therapy procedure performed to allows continued physiologic development and formation of the root's apex apically to the dressing material.The pulp tissue within the chamber and partial in the canals are removed, while apical vital and apparent healthy part is remained. Apexogenesis can be regarded as a very deep pulpotomy.

4. 根尖诱导成形术 (apexification): Apexification is a method of inducing a calcified barrier at the apex of a nonvital tooth with incomplete root formation to produce an apical stop or constriction.

5. 牙髓再生治疗术 (regenerative endodontic treatment): This novel procedure exploits the full regeneration potential of a functional pulp-dentin complex to obtain further root development and thickening of dentinal walls. This approach involves the use of antibiotic paste to disinfect the canal and no artificial materials were used to fill the canal space. This allows the pulp-like tissue to regenerate in the canal space.
