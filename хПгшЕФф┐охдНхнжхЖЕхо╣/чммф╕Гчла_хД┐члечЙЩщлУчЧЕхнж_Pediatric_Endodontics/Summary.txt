The evaluation of the dental pulp status is the basis to identify appropriate dental treatment that should be used, which, however, turns out to be difficult in children because of their limited expression capability and physical development. For children's teeth, applying which kind of treatments such as direct pulp capping, partial pulpotomy/pulpotomy and pulpectomy (apexification) could be based on medical history, clinical and radiographic examination, and even the status of the wholly exposed coronal pulp. When it comes to young permanent teeth, maintaining the vitality of the pulp is essential to allow root development as naturally as possible. Besides, the target of many present clinical research have focused on inducing stem cells originated from residual pulp tissue in young permanent tooth, apical papilla or blood to differentiate into pulp cells with odontoblast function and then continue promoting root development. No matter what treatment has been applied, patients should be reviewed regularly until the completion of tooth development. Whenever periapical lesion of primary tooth violates underlying tooth germ, it should be extracted.
