牙列的模式发育 ( patterning of the dentition ): The determination of specific tooth types at their correct positions in the jaws is referred to as patterning of the dentition. Patterning plays a key role in development from the initial axial (head-to-tail) specification of the embryo through its segmentation and ultimately to the development of the dentition. Patterning is a spatial and temporal event as exemplified by regional development of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which occurs at different times and involves the classical processes of induction, competence, and differentiation.
