Since Professor Per-Ingvar Br√•nemark established the principles of modern implantology, clinical and experimental research in the field has continued improvement. Implant immediate provisionalization implies the application of functional or nonfunctional load to an implant at the time of surgical placement or shortly thereafter; ie, generally considered to be loading within 48 hours of implant placement. The concept of immediate loading included the immediate functional loading and immediate nonfunctional loading. The former means implant prosthesis is seated at the time of implant placement and immediately subjected to functional loading. The latter implies implant prosthesis is seated at the time of implant placement but kept out of direct occlusal contact. Loading occurs from lip and tongue pressure and contact with food, but not from contact with the opposing teeth.

At present some researches have indicated that immediate loading of implants is well documented for completely edentulous mandible and for the completely edentulous maxilla, and it has been found to be a highly predictable treatment modality. The immediate rehabilitation of post-extraction sites has grown more and more popular over recent years. There are many elements involved in the implant immediate loading treatment results, such as implant system, implant surface feature and micromorphology, patient selection, splinting of number of implants and achievement of enough primary stability. Distribution of the occlusal load on a larger surface at the bone-implant interface is a favorable biomechanical condition, which contributes to increasing stability of the structure. Further studies are required to document the long-term results of immediately loaded partial prostheses and for single-tooth implants in the posterior sectors.
