2. 即刻功能性负重 ( immediate functional loading ): Implant prosthesis is seated at the time of implant placement and immediately subjected to functional loading.

3. 即刻非功能性负重 (immediate nonfunctional loading): Implant prosthesis is seated at the time of implant placement but kept out of direct occlusal contact. Loading occurs from lip and tongue pressure and contact with food, but not from contact with the opposing teeth.
