The study of tumors and tumor-like lesions of the oral cavity and adjacent structures constitutes an important phase of dentistry because of the role which the dentist plays in the diagnosis and treatment of these lesions. Although tumors constitute only a small minority of the pathologic conditions seen by the dentist, they are of great significance since they have the potential ability to jeopardize the health and longevity of the patient. Many of the great variety of oral tumors will seldom be seen by the general practitioner of dentistry. Yet it is of utmost importance that he is familiar with them so that when one does present itself, he may either institute appropriate treatment or refer the patient to the proper therapist.

A tumor, by definition, is simply a swelling of the tissue; in the strict sense, the word does not imply a neoplastic process. Many of the lesions discussed in this section are called tumors only because they are manifested as swellings; they are in no way actually related to true neoplasms.

Neoplasia is a poorly understood biologic phenomenon which, in some instances, cannot be clearly differentiated from other processes or tissue reactions. Although no precise definition of a neoplasm exists, particularly one without exception, a neoplasm is often considered an independent, uncoordinated new growth of tissue which is potentially capable of unlimited proliferation and which does not regress after removal of the stimulus which produced the lesion.
