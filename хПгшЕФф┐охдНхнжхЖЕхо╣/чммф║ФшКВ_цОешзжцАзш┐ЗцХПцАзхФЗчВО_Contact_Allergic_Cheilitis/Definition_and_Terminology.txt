艾滋病 ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS ): is the outcome of chronic HIV infection and consequent depletion of ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells, which is defined as a condition with ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count $< {200}$ cells $/{\mu 1}$ or the presence of any AIDS-defining opportunistic infections, central nervous system diseases and tumors with or without changes in ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count. HIV infection is usually acquired through sexual intercourse, exposure to infected blood, or perinatal transmission.
