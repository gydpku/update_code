Acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) is the outcome of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and consequent depletion of CD4 ${}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells. HIV infection is usually acquired through sexual intercourse, exposure to infected blood, or perinatal transmission. HIV is a type of retroviridae which consists of virus core gene and envelope. There are 2 epidemic strains of HIV ( HIV-1 and HIV-2 ) around the world. HIV-1 causes most HIV infections worldwide including China, and leads to faster disease progression than HIV-2. The majority of new HIV infections enter the ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells via the CCR5 coreceptor. ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells are not only the targeted cells of HIV, but also the primary functional cells in antiviral immunity. Most HIV/AIDS patients suffer progressive decline in the ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count or $\mathrm{{CD4}}$ percentage of total lymphocytes, and ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count $< {200}$ cells $/{\mu 1}$ is a reflect of severe immunosuppression. Laboratory testing methods for HIV/AIDS include HIV antibodies assays, ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count or CD4 percentage of total lymphocytes, HIV-RNA levels test, HIV viral load and genotypic resistance assays. Detection of HIV infection is facilitated by HIV tests that detect HIV p24 antigen prior to seroconversion and subsequently confirmatory tests. The ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count and the viral load also benefit HIV case definition and are independent predictors of HIV progression.

The clinical manifestations of HIV/AIDS patients vary from 3 different clinical outcomes. Acute and early HIV infection is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, rash, myalgia/arthralgia, diarrhea, and headache after HIV infection for $2 \sim  4$ weeks. The presence of a prolonged symptomatic illness ( $> {14}$ days) during early infection appears to correlate with more rapid progression to AIDS. Then, patients may be asymptomatic for about $6 \sim  8$ years. Finally, patients suffer a ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count $< {200}$ cells $/\mu \mathrm{l}$ , or with the presence of any AIDS-defining conditions, and are defined as AIDS patients. AIDS-defining conditions are more frequently or more severely opportunistic illnesses because of immunosuppression. For instance, mucocutaneous candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, seborrheic dermatitis, and herpetic infections, can develop with higher ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells counts but occur with greater frequency and severity when the ${\mathrm{{CD4}}}^{ + }\mathrm{T}$ cells count $< {200}$ cells $/{\mu 1}$ . Prior to introduction and widespread use of combination ART, AIDS-associated illnesses were the principal cause of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. Hematologic aberrations including anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia are also common in the setting of AIDS. In addition, AIDS patients can develop central nervous system diseases and tumors regardless of the CD4 ${}^{ + }$ T cells count.

Although there are no efficient therapies to cure AIDS, highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) dramatically prolongs the life of HIV/AIDS patients. The rate of HIV progression can be influence such as baseline CD4 count, viral load, coinfection, host immune response and genetic factors, age, and possibly substance use. Notably, the management of HIV/AIDS needs MDT and sufficient awareness concerning the prevention of HIV transmission.
