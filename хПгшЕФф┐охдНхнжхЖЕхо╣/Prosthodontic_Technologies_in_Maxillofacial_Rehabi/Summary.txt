This chapter not only describes the scope, classification of maxillofacial defects, but also introduces their influence on the patients. However, the optimal rehabilitation of maxillofacial defects is hard to accomplish because the support and retention for the prosthesis is normally poor and difficult to achieve. In this chapter, the principles for rehabilitation are firstly introduced. The traditional technologies in making obturator prosthesis, mandibular guidance, eye prosthesis, ear prosthesis, and nasal prosthesis, etc. are detailedly described as well. Along with the advancing of material science and technology, the implant prostheses, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing, biomimetic materials and prostheses will gradually be applied in maxillofacial rehabilitation and finally contribute greatly to the improved health and life quality of patients.
