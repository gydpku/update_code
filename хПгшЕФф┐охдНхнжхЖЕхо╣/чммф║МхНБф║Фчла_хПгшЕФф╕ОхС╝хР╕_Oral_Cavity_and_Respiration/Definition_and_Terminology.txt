咳嗽反射 (Cough reflex): The cough reflex has both sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) components. With cough, smooth muscle movement is incorporated into the actual cough reflex in order to move the irritant or blockage up the airway and out.

$\square$ 呼吸 (Mouth breathing) : Mouth breathing is a respiratory pattern where people primarily breathe in and out through their mouths, rather than using the nose for the bulk of respiration.

阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征(Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome): Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome ( OSAHS ) is characterized by brief episodes of complete or partial upper airway collapse during sleep, causing an increased thoraco-abdominal effort and a decreased arterial oxygen saturation, leading to an arousal response which takes the form of apneas and periodic hypopneas during sleep.
