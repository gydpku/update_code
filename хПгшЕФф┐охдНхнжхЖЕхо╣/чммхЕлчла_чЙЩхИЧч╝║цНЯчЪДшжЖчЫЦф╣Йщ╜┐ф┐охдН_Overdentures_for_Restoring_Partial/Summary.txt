This chapter describes the scope, history, the future developing trend of maxillofacial prosthetics, and the therapies to achieve the optimal rehabilitation of maxillofacial defects. The etiologies of maxillofacial defects include congenital or development factors and acquired factors such as disease, or trauma. The incidence of maxillofacial defects is low, but they normally cause catastrophic impacts on the patient's health, and life quality due to the severely compromised appearance, function, psychology, and social communication of the patients. Maxillofacial rehabilitation is hard accomplished because the support and retention for the prosthesis is normally achieved with many difficulties due to the enormous defects. Some prophase surgery such as bone graft implantation, soft tissue trimming or plastic surgery, eye socket reconstruction, labio-bucco-lingual vestibuloplasty, zygo-buccal area plasty will facilitate the support, retention, or function of maxillofacial prostheses. In this chapter, the indication, contraindication, principles for rehabilitation, the treatment planning, maxillofacial materials, treatment procedures, and maintenance of different prostheses such as obturator prosthesis, mandibular guidance, eye prostheses, ear prostheses, and nasal prostheses, etc. are detailedly delineated as well. Because of the complicated conditions encountered in maxillofacial rehabilitation, a more intensive and comprehensive multidisciplinary collaboration will be required and this will further benefits the treatment. Along with the advancing of material science and technology, the usage of osseointegrated implants, digital prosthodontics, biomimetic and bionic materials and prostheses, tissue-engineered structures and organs in maxillofacial rehabilitation will gradually make the debut and finally make the great contributions to the health and life quality of patients.
