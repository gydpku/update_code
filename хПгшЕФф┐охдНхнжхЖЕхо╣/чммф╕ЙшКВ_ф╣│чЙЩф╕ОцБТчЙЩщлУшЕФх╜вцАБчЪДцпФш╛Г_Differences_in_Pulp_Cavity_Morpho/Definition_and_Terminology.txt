下颌卸载反射 Jaw-unloading reflex

The jaw-unloading reflex is a protective reflex in that it prevents the teeth from crashing together forcibly when a hard substance held between the teeth breaks suddenly. The most common, everyday example is cracking nuts between the teeth. The receptors and interneurons involed have not yet been identified.

肌紧张 Muscle tone

The stretch reflex myotatic reflex caused when the muscle is pulled persistently and slowly, show as the muscle contract slightly without obvious action.

侧方运动 Lateral movement or Bennett movement ( laterotrusion )

The bodily lateral movement or lateral shift of the mandible toward the working side that occurs during lateral excursion ( Bennett shift, side shift of the mandible ) . Thus, as the mandible is moved into left lateral excursion, in addition to rotation of the condyle on the ( left ) working side and translation of the ( right ) nonworking side condyle, the mandible ( and therefore both condyles ) will shift bodily to the left by a small amount in most individuals.

𬌗架 Articulator

A mechanical instrument that represents the temporomandibular joints and jaws, to which maxillary and mandibular casts may be attached to simulate some or all mandibular movements.

简化面弓 Arbitrary Face-bow

A caliper-like instrument used to record the spatial relationship of the maxillary arch to some anatomic reference point or points and then transfer this relationship to an articulator; it orients the dental cast in the same relationship to the opening axis of the articulator. Customarily the anatomic references one selected anterior point which is not the mandibular condyles transverse horizontal axis.

运动面弓 Kinematic facebow

A facebow with adjustable caliper ends used to locate the transverse horizontal axis of the mandible.
