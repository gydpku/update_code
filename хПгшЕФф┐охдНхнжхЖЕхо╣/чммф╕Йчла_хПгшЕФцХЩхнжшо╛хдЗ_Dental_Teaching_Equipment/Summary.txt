In this chapter, we mainly describe equipment used for dental experimental teaching, e.g., dental simulation teaching equipment, dental simulation teaching evaluation equipment, dental virtual simulation system and dental teaching simulation robots. Among these equipment, dental simulation teaching equipment has been widely used and occupied an important position in stomatological teaching. Meanwhile, real-time evaluation dental simulation teaching equipment can evaluate and score each student's performance in the reduction of tooth preparation by locating the position of the burs and the artificial tooth precisely with an accuracy of ${0.1}\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ , similar to the GPS system in car navigation, which is more objective and standardized compared with traditional scoring method basing on teachers' individual judgment and subjective experience. In addition, dental virtual simulation system has a force feedback system, which makes students' operation feedback closer to the actual feel, and it also can simulate oral diseases or soft tissue bleeding or other scenes that are difficult to simulate under a variety of conventional experimental conditions. It takes the advantages of safety and environmental protection, and the students' practice process also can be repeatedly played back which is good for students' reflection. Finally, dental teaching simulation robots are designed to focus on strengthening stomatological humanistic education and the training of doctor-patient communication. With the development of artificial intelligence, e.g., automatic speech recognition techniques, and the reduction of manufacturing cost, these kinds of robots will be more widely used in dental teaching. In summary, the domestic developed dental educational systems mentioned above have obvious advantages, due to the fact that their built-in teaching cases and software upgrades can not only better meet the requirement of daily stomatological teaching, but also has the ability to develop and customize according to different teaching needs, thus enjoying great development space to provide better teaching and learning experience.
