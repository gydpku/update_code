Medications for dental pulp diseases include anti-carious agents, anti-dentin sensitive desensitizers, tooth bleaching agents, vital pulp therapy agent and root canal therapy agents. It is necessary to master the pharmacological action, indications and precautions of each representative drug.

The main function of anti-carious agents are to enhance the anti-carious ability of teeth and control dental plaque to inhibit the growth of bacteria. Representative drugs include sodium fluoride, stannous fluoride, and fluorine acid phosphate.

Anti-dentin sensitive desensitizers can alleviate or eliminate pain or discomfort caused by dentin sensitivity without damage to pulp tissue. The commonly used drugs are fluoride, potassium salt and compound desensitizer.

The commonly used tooth bleaching agents are hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate and urea peroxide.

The main function of pulp capping agents is to isolate the stimulation of external physical and chemical factors on pulp, protect dental pulp health, provide a microenvironment for pulp repair, stimulate and induce the differentiation of dental pulp cells, thus forming restorative dentin and promoting pulp tissue healing. The representative drugs are calcium hydroxide, mineral trioxide polymer and zinc oxide clove oil.

Formaldehyde cresol is only suitable for deciduous teeth.

Root canal therapy agents are divided into root canal irrigants and root canal disinfectants. at present, the commonly used root canal irrigants include sodium hypochlorite solution, hydrogen peroxide solution, EDTA chelating agent, etc. calcium hydroxide paste is often used as the preferred drug for root canal disinfection, but phenolic resin has been abandoned.

Pulp devitalizer is highly toxic and corrosive to tissues, so it is recommended to be used with caution.
