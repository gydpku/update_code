1. 行为管理 ( behavior management ) : Behavior management is a continuum of interaction involving the dentist and dental team, the patient, and the parent directed toward communication and education. Its goal is to ease fear and anxiety while promoting an understanding of the need for good oral health and the process by which that is achieved.

2. 告知-演示-操作 (tell-show-do): The technique involves verbal explanations of procedures in phrases appropriate to the developmental level of the patient (tell); demonstrations for the patient of the visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile aspects of the procedure in a carefully defined, nonthreatening setting (show); and then, without deviating from the explanation and demonstration, completion of the procedure (do).

3. 语音语调控制 ( voice control ) : It is a controlled alteration of voice volume, tone, or pace to influence and direct the patient's behavior. Parents unfamiliar with this possibly aversive technique may benefit from an explanation prior to its use to prevent misunderstanding.

4. 正强化 (positive reinforcement: ) It is an effective technique to reward desired behaviors and, thus, strengthen the recurrence of those behaviors. Social reinforcers include positive voice modulation, facial expression, verbal praise, and appropriate physical demonstrations of affection by all members of the dental team. Nonsocial reinforcers include tokens and toys.

5. 分散注意力 (distraction): It is the technique of diverting the patient's attention from what may be perceived as an unpleasant procedure. Giving the patient a short break during a stressful procedure can be an effective use of distraction prior to considering more advanced behavior guidance techniques.
