1. 牙齿震荡 (concussion): Concussion is an injury to the tooth-supporting structures without abnormal loosening or displacement of the tooth, but with marked reaction to percussion.

2. 亚脱位 (subluxation): Subluxation is an injury to the tooth-supporting structures with abnorma loosening, but without displacement of the tooth.

3. 釉质裂纹 (enamel infraction): Enamel infraction is an incomplete fracture (crack) of the enamel without loss of tooth substance.

4. 外伤牙弹性夹板固定 (flexible splinting of traumatized teeth): Flexible splinting is $\varepsilon$ physiologic fixation of displaced teeth, which have slightly vertical and horizontal flexibility, and equal to normal tooth mobility in order to support healing.

5. 牙齿固连 (healing with ankylosis): Ankylosis represents histologically a fusion of the alveolan bone and the root surface. The ankylosed root becomes part of the normal bone remodeling system and is gradually replaced by bone.

6. 防护牙托 (mouthguard): mouthguard is a protector of mouth, and designed to prevent tooth injuries by absorbing and deflecting blows to tooth, to shield the lips, tongue and gingival tissues rom laceration, to prevent opposing teeth from coming into violent contact, and provide the nandible with resilient support, which absorbs an impact that might fracture the unsupported angle or condyle of the mandible.
