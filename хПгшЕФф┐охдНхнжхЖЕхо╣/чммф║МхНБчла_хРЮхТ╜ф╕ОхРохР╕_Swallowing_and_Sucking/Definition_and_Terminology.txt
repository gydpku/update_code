吞咽 Swallowing or deglutition The process that usually involves movement of food from the mouth to the stomach via the esophagus. Coordination of muscles is needed from the tongue to the esophageal sphincter.

反射动作 Reflex activity

The involuntary functioning or movement of any organ or body part in response to a particular stimulus. The function or action occurs immediately, without the involvement of the will or consciousness.

开𬌗吞咽 Tooth apart swallowing

Instead of bringing the teeth of the two jaws together to provide a firm outer wall against which the tongue can act, the subject keeps them apart in the rest position and uses cheeks and lips as the outer wall. This means the tongue thrusts forward between the anterior teeth and the lips are often compressed by action of the circumoral muscles to assist in providing the rigid wall. This swallowing pattern is often seen in subjects who have or have had a habit of sucking thumbs or fingers.

吮吸 Sucking

The act or process of drawing into the mouth, in which the partial vacuum produced inside the oral

cavity through the joint action of the cheeks, lips, and tongue, draws through a narrow opening between

the lips air, liquids, or any substance or object, such as a finger.
