1. All-on-4: The technique for full arch rehabilitation is a surgical and prosthodontic procedure. It consists of the rehabilitation both edentulous maxilla and mandible with fixed prosthesis by placing four implants in the anterior jaw, in which two implants in front will be straight and the other two in posterior would be tilted. The fixed prosthesis with 12 to 14 teeth supported by 4 implants will be finished immediately on the day of surgery.

2. 笑线 ( smile line ): Imaginary line following the contour of the upper lip in the act of smiling. The contour of the lower lip generally parallels the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary anterior teeth. In arranging maxillary artificial teeth, the incisal-occlusal plane parallels the smile line to project a pleasing appearance.

3. 黑 三 角 (black triangle): Missing papilla between teeth when the interproximal bone has been reduced in height. The black triangle is considered as an aesthetic compromised status.
