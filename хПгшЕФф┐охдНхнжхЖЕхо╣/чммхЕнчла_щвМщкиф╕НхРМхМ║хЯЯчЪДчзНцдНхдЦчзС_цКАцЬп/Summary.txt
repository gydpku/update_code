This chapter mainly describes the principle and key issue of implant placement in different area of jaws. The incision should be designed as less invasive as possible on condition that the surgical area is essentially exposed. The bone of the frontal mandible has the most suitable quality for implant placement, and it is also the first choice of location for implants in edentulous patient. Due to the vita structure such as the mandibular nerve and the maxillary sinus, the implant depth should be carefully controlled in the post area of jaws. Bone augmentation procedure should be adopted if necessary. In the molar area, the implant axis should be parallel to the axis of nature teeth as the chewing force can be conducted along the long axis of implant to the jaw. To restore the frontal maxillary teeth with implant is the most challenge work in implant treatment. The correct three dimensional implant position is the prerequisite of achieving aesthetic result for implant restoration. Multiple teeth lose in the frontal maxilla makes it even more challenging. Insufficient soft tissue could bea very common clinical problem. The doctor should carefully evaluate the soft and hard tissue conditions before, inform possible aesthetic risks and explain clearly to the patient. Immediate fixed implant restoration of edentulous patient is a new trend in recent years, All-on-4 concept solves the inconvenience for the patients with edentulous or hopeless teeth during the treatment period and also shows predictable clinical result.
