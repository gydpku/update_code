Angular cheilitis is the term used for an infection involving the lip commissures. Candida, Staphylococcus and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus are major pathogens involved in angular cheilitis. Other contributing factors may agitate the infections, including reduced vertical dimension, nutritional deficiency (iron and vitamin ${\mathrm{B}}_{12}$ or folic acid deficiency), and diabetes (rare), neutropenia and AIDS.

Patients present with dryness, scaliness, rhagades, crust and erythema on the lip commissures. In ${30}\%$ of the cases, there is coexistence with denture stomatitis.

Barrier creams such as petrolatum, zinc oxide, or lip balm can help protect irritated skin. Based on the pathogens causing the infection, topical antibiotics and anti-fungal agents are both effective. Corticosteroid can be used to reduce inflammation.
