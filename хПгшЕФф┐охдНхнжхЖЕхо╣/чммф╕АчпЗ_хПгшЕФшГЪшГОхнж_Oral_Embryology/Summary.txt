At the end of the 3rd week, neural crest cells from vicinity of neural tube begin to migrate in dorsoventral direction. They give rise to a lot of important tissues and cells including some tooth tissues and periodontal tissues. Although the neural crest tissues arise from ectoderm, they exhibit properties of mesenchyme. As a result, the tissue they form is called "ectomesenchyme". The primitive oral cavity (oral pit or stomodeum) appears during the 4th prenatal week, initially as a pit located between the growing forebrain cranially and the growing heart ventrally. The pharyngeal arches develop as five or six pairs of horizontally positioned mesenchymal bars surrounding the oropharynx. The facial region including its all soft and hard tissues formed from the middle and lateral processes, mandibular and maxillary processes. The ectodermal lining of the oral cavity provides two endocrine glands, the thyroid gland from the tongue and the anterior pituitary gland from the roof of the mouth. Tongue begins to develop from 2 lateral lingual swellings and 1 hypobranchial eminence at the 4th week. Formation of the palate from primary palate and lateral palatine processes separates the oral cavity and nasal cavity. At first, lateral palatine processes growth beside the tongue and they elevate from beside the tongue to position themselves above it when tongue slide forward. Major and minor salivary glands arise from their corresponding oral mucosa. Developmental regulation of oral maxillofacial region is extremely complicated. The advances on molecular biology and sequencing of the human genome have revolutionized our understanding of the developmental mechanism. Derangement of any of these complex mechanisms results in dysmorphogenesis and consequent anomalies. There are many kinds of deformities related to maxillofacial development. Among them, the most common anomalies are lip and palate cleft.
