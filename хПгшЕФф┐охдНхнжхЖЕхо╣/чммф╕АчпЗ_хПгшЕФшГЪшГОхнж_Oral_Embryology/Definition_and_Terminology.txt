外间充质 (ectomesenchyme): Neural crest cells in the head region have very important roles of assisting in the formation of the cranial sensory ganglia and forming most of the connective tissue of the head. Embryonic connective tissue elsewhere is derived from mesoderm and is known as mesenchyme, whereas in the head it is known as ectomesenchyme, reflecting its origin from neuroectoderm.
