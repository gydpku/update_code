This chapter introduces medications for temporomandibular disorders, medical imaging contrast agents, plaque disclosing agents and vascular sclerosis agents.Medications for temporomandibular disorders mainly include analgesics, glucocorticoids, chondroprotectants, joint lubricants, muscle relaxants, antidepressants and anxiolytics. Medical imaging contrast agent is used in medical imaging examinations. It can change the contrast between normal tissues and organs, as well as between lesions and normal tissues and organs, to show its shape and function, thereby providing an important basis for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diseases. Representative medicines for medical imaging contrast agents include iodinated oil, meglumine diatrizoate and iohexol. Plaque disclosing agents can stain plaques, and their representative drugs include sodium tetraiodofluorescein and basic fuchsin.

Vascular sclerosing agents include surfactant-based sclerosing agents, chemical sclerosing agents and penetrating sclerosing agents, and one of its representative drugs is lauromacrogol.
