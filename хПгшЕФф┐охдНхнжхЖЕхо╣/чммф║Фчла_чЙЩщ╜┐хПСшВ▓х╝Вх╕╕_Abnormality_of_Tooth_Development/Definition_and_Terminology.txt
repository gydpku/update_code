1. 特纳牙 (Turner tooth): Turner first described this localized type of hypoplasia. He noted defects in the enamel of two premolars and traced the defects to apical infection of the nearest primary molar. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from local infection is called Turner tooth.

2. 低龄儿童龋 ( early childhood caries, ECC ): The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) defines early childhood caries (ECC) as the presence of one or more decayed (noncavitated or cavitated), missing (due to caries), or filled tooth surfaces in any primary tooth in a child 71 months of age or younger.

3. 重度低龄儿童龋(severe early childhood caries, S-ECC):The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) also specifies that, in children younger than 3 years of age, any signs of smooth-surface caries or dmfs $\geq  4$ (3 years of age), $\mathrm{{dmfs}} \geq  5$ (4 years of age) and $\mathrm{{dmfs}} \geq  6$ (5 years of age) are indicative of severe early childhood caries (S-ECC).

4. 猖獗龋 ( rampant dental caries ) : There is no complete agreement on the definition of rampant caries or on the clinical picture of this condition. Rampant dental caries has been defined by Massleras a "suddenly appearing, widespread, rapidly burrowing type of caries, resulting in early involvement of the pulp and affecting those teeth usually regarded as immune to ordinary decay." 118 儿童口腔医学(第 3 版)
