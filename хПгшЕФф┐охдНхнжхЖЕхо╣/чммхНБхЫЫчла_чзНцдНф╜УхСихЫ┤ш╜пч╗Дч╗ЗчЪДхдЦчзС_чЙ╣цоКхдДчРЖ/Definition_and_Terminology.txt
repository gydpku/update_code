1. 角化黏膜游离移植物(free gingival graft, FGG):Soft tissue graft taken from the patient's palate that includes the epithelium.

2. 上皮下结缔组织游离移植物 (subepithelial connective tissue graft, CTG): Graft of connective tissue taken from the palate for root coverage in instances of recession or lack of keratinized tissue. This procedure has been adopted in implant dentistry with the purpose of enhancing soft tissue contours for esthetics. The advantage of this procedure as compared to a free gingival graft is its esthetic superiority, dual blood supply, and less donor-site postoperative morbidity.
