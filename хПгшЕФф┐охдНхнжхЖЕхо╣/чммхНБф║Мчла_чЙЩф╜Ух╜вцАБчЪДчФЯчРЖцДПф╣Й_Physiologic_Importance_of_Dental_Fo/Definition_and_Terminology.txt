接触区 Contact area

Portion of a tooth where adjacent tooth crowns in the same arch physically touch on each proximal surface.

邻间隙 Interproximal spaces

These triangularly shaped spaces are formed by proximal surfaces in contact and normally filled by gingival tissue/papillae. The base of the triangle is the alveolar process, the sides of the triangle are the proximal surfaces of the contacting teeth, and the apex of the triangle is in the area of contact.

外展隙 Embrasures

When two teeth in the same arch are in contact, their curvatures adjacent to the contact areas form spillway spaces called embrasures. 颈线 Cervical line

The cementoenamel junction ( CEJ ) is visualized anatomically as the cervical line. Normal epithelial attachment follows the curvature of the CEJ, which makes the CEJ a significant landmark for probing the level of the attachment of fibers to the tooth. The height of normal gingival tissue, mesially and distally, on approximating teeth is directly dependent on the heights of the epithelial attachment on these teeth.
