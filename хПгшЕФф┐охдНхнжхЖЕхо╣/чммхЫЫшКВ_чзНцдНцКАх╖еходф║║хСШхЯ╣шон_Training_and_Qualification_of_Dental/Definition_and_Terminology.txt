1. 被动就位 ( passive fit ) : Adaptation of one component to another in a manner that does not impart strain. In dental implant prosthodontics, the creation of passively fitting prostheses is desirable.

2. 技工代型 ( laboratory analog ): Cope of a prosthetic or implant element used in laboratory fabrication procedures.

3. 技工螺丝 ( laboratory screw ): Element used in dental laboratory procedures in the fabrication of the prosthesis. Laboratory screws can be modified, eg, elongated or made from a different alloy, from the definitive design.

4. 修复螺丝 ( prosthetic screw ) : Prosthetic component serving as a retention screw, used to connect the prosthetic component to the mesostructure or to a transmucosal element.

5. 固定螺丝 ( fixation screw ) : Type of attachment screw used to secure a prosthetic component.

6. 生物相容性 (biocompatibility): Condition whereby the body does not respond to a foreign substance ( eg, metal ) but recognizes it immunologically as self. Biocompatible materials do not lead to acute or chronic infla mmatory responses nor do they prevent proper differentiation of implant-surrounding tissues.
