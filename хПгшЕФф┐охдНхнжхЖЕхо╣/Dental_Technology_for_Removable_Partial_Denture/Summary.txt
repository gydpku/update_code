The manufacturing technology of complete denture is complex. Standard technical procedures in complete denture manufacturing will bring improved effect on the quality of the complete denture. This chapter consists of the contents such as the quality standards, and operational processes of restorative technology. The detailed instructions of main processing technologies are also given here, including impression and cast, maxillo-mandibular relationship recording, selection and arrangement of artificial teeth, wax pattern preparation, layered flasking, casting polymerization, selective occlusal grinding on the articulator, remounting articulator, and polishing technique, etc. Only when the standard operation procedures were followed in each step, could the final restoration harvest best clinical effects.
