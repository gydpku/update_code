This chapter mainly introduces oral and maxillofacial X-ray imaging equipment, including dental X-ray machines, dental panoramic X-ray machines, and oral and maxillofacial cone beam CT. With the development of digital medical imaging technology, it has been realized from one-dimensional information to two-dimensional images, and then three-dimensional visualization of human tissues, which brings convenience to the diagnosis, management, and research of clinical cases, and improves the operating efficiency in dental hospitals. In addition to the advantages of low radiation dose, high speed, high resolution, easy management, easy retrieval, and visualization, digital medical imaging technology is also the core of hospital network management. Furthermore, the existing HIS or PACS systems in hospitals both take digital medical imaging equipment as the core. At the same time, it is also a key part of the digital diagnosis and treatment technology of stomatology, which is particularly obvious in the application of oral and maxillofacial cone beam CT. It is not only used as a means of diagnosis and treatment of diseases, but also as a method of collecting three-dimensional data of the maxillofacial region, in order to realize the design of surgical plan from two-dimensional treatment to three-dimensional treatment, and even the display of the surgical process and the prediction and evaluation of the surgical effect.
