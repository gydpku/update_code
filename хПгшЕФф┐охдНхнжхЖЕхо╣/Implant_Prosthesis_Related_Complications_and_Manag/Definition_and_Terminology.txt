植体周健康(peri-implant health)In health, the peri-implant site is characterized by absence of erythema, bleeding on probing, swelling and suppuration.

植体周黏膜炎 (peri-implant mucositis) the presence of inflammation limited to the oral mucosal tissue, with no loss of marginal bone tissue.

植体周炎 (peri-implantitis) is a plaque-associated pathological condition occurring in tissues around dental implants, characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and subsequent progressive loss of supporting bone.

逆行性植体周炎 (retrograde peri-implantitis): is defined as a clinically symptomatic periapical lesion which is diagnosed as a radiolucency that develops shortly after an implant insertion, in which the coronal portion of the implant achieves a normal bone-implant interface.

植体周黏膜(peri-implant mucosa):The soft tissue that surrounds dental implants is termed peri-implant mucosa. The soft tissues reveal three kinds of epithelium: the oral gingival epithelium, the oral sucular epithelium and the junctional epithelium.
