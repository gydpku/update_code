Peri-implant diseases that occur following successful osseointegration are a result of an imbalance between the bacterial challenge and host response. Currently, peri-implant diseases and conditions include: peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis, hard and soft tissue deficiencies.

Peri-implant tissues includes soft and hard tissue compartments around osseointegrated dental implants. The soft tissue compartment is denoted "peri-implant mucosa" and is formed during the wound healing process that follows implant/abutment placement. The hard tissue compartment forms a contact relationship to the implant surface to secure implant stability.

The healthy peri-implant mucosa is, at the microscopic level, comprised of a core of connective tissue covered by either a keratinized or non-keratinized epithelium. The results from the available studies in man and from animal experiments show that the peri-implant mucosa averages about 3 to $4\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ high, and presents with an epithelium (about $2\mathrm{\;{mm}}$ long) facing the implant surface. The epithelia is attached via hemi-desmosomes to the implant surface. The equivalent fibers run in a direction parallel with the implant and fail to attach to the metal body. The soft tissue attachment to implants is properly established several weeks following implant placement. Most of the intrabony part of the implant appears to be in contact with mineralized bone ( about ${60}\%$ ), while the remaining portion faces bone marrow, vascular structures, or fibrous tissue. During healing following implant installation, bone modeling occurs that may result in some reduction of the marginal bone level.

Epidemiologically, the prevalence of the peri-implantitis ranges from ${22}\%$ to ${56}\%$ of the population and the peri-implantitis is more prevalent.

Peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are caused by bacteria. But there is evidence that some indicators are associated with peri-implant diseases, such as poor oral hygiene, history of periodontitis and smoking. There are limited evidences are associated with peri-implant diseases: such as diabetes and alcohol consumption. It is imperative that periodontal disease is treated before implant placement and regular periodontal maintenace are necessary. There are some limited evidences linking peri-implantitis to other factors such as: lack of peri-implant keratinized mucosa and positioning of implants that make it difficult to perform oral hygiene and maintenance. Evidence suggests that progressive crestal bone loss around implants in the absence of clinical signs of soft tissue inflammation is a rare event.
