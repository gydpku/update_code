This chapter depicts the basic techniques and skills in the fabrication process of implant supported prosthesis. Implant related technician work shares the same principles as the conventional prosthetic production process from a single crown to complete denture. The demands of fabrication accuracy and passive fit are even higher in implant supported prosthesis, which play an important role in the long term results of implant restoration.
