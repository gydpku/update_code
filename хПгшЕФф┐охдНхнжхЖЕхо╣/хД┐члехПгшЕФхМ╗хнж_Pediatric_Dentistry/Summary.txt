The pediatric dentist must obtain a history from the parents of child patients before commencing patient care. A thorough dental history is essential to guide the practitioner's clinical assessment, make an accurate diagnosis, and develop a comprehensive preventive and therapeutic program for each patient. An accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date medical history is necessary for correct diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Family history is asked to assess the presence of any inherited disease pattern or trait. Together with the history, clinical examination aids in determining the correct diagnosis and devising the treatment plan. Clinical examination includes general assessment, extraoral examination, intraoral soft and hard tissue examination, assessment of the developing occlusion, radiographic examination and laboratory examination. The diagnostic methods employed in oral examination include visual examination, exploration, percussion, palpation, mobility testing, biting test, thermal and electric pulp testing. Once the dentist has obtained the medical and dental histories and evaluated the facts obtained during the diagnostic procedures, the diagnoses should be made and a sequential prioritized treatment plan developed. The treatment plan should include emergency, control, consultation, treatment and recall phase. Each patient should have an individual dental record. An electronic patient record is becoming more common-place.
