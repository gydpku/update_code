固定-活动联合修复 (fixed-removable prostheses): Fixed-removable prosthesis is a kind of prosthesis for restoration of partial edentulous jaws with attachment or telescopic crown as direct retainer. These prostheses comprise two parts: one part will be fixed on the root, crown of natural teeth or implant. the other part will be attached to the removable denture. The prostheses have characteristics of both fixed and removable dentures.

附着体 (attachment): Attachment is a mechanical device for the fixation, retention, and stabilization of a prosthesis. It is a retainer consisting of a metal receptacle and a closely fitting part. The former (matrix component) is usually contained within the normal or expanded contours of the crown of the abutment tooth and the latter (patrix component) is attached to a pontic or the denture framework.

套筒冠 (telescopic crown): An artificial crown (framework) constructed to fit over a coping, another crown, a bar connector or any other suitable rigid support for the dental prosthesis.
