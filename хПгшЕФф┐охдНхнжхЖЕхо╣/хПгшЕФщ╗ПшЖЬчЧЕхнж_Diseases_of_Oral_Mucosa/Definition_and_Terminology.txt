口腔黏膜 ( oral mucosa ) : The term mucous membrane is used to describe the moist lining of the gastrointestinal tract, nasal passages, and other bodycavities that communicate with the exterior. In the oral cavity this lining is called the oral mucous membrane, or oral mucosa.

正角化 (orthokeratinization): In some regions of the masticatory oral epithelium, the surface layer is composed of flat ( squamous ) cells that stain bright pink with the histologic dye eosin ( i.e., they appear eosinophilic) and do not contain any nuclei. This pattern of maturation of these cells is termedorthokeratinization.

角化不全 (parakeratosis): This is a variation of keratinization in which the surface layer of epithelium stains for keratin, as described in orthokeratinization, but shrunken ( or pyknotic ) nuclei are retained in many or all of the squames.

福代斯斑 (Fordyce's spot): Sebaceous glands are present on the lips, labial mucosa, and buccal mucosa in over three quarters of adults and have been described occasionally in the alveolar mucosa and dorsum of the tongue. They are not associated with hair follicles and are sometimes called sebaceous follicles. Clinically, they appear as pale yellow spots, sometimes called Fordyce's spots( or granules) or Fordyce's disease, although they do not represent a pathologic condition.

上皮钉突 (epithelial spike): The interface between oral epithelium and connective tissue is usually irregular, and upward projections of connective tissue, called the connective tissue papillae, interdigitate with epithelial spike, sometimes called the rete spike.

基底膜 (basement membrane): In a histological section, the interface between epithelium and connective tissue appears as a structureless layer about $1 \sim  {2\mu }\mathrm{m}$ thick, termed as the basement membrane. At the ultrastructural level, this region has a complex structure.
